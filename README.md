# Targeted Marketing for Airbnb Property Hosts
We leverage advanced analytics techniques to pinpoint properties registered with Airbnb that might potentially leave the platform in the upcoming quarter. This strategic approach enables the organization to identify specific properties, allowing for the creation of targeted retention marketing strategies. This ensures optimized resource allocation by avoiding broad, indiscriminate spending on all properties.

# Churn Definition in Panel Data
Each property is categorized as “Not Churned” for the initial quarters it sustains and as “Churned” for the quarter it leaves. For example, if a property remains with Airbnb for five quarters, it is labeled “Not Churned” for the first four and “Churned” for the fifth. This approach allows us to discern the contributing factors to property churn, aiding in the prediction of churn probabilities for current-quarter properties.
